<p>Hi!</p>

<p>
Games in real space is a website dedicated to casual outdoor games,
currently focusing on Prospect Park, Brooklyn. The goal is to create a stream
of diverse outdoor activities that people can join on a whim—capture the flag,
pick-up socker, frisbee, etc—and at the same time to provide a space for
people to create and share games of their own.
</p>

<p> We live in a world that is more isolated and virtual than ever before.
Let's get people together, in person, having fun and moving their bodies— playing games <i>in real space.</i><br/>
</p>


<p> Games in real space is invite-only. If you would like to join and do not
have an invitation, you can send an email to <a
href="mailto:webmaster@inreal.space">webmaster@inreal.space</a>. </p>
