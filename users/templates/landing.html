<p>Hi!</p>

<p> Games in real space is a website dedicated to casual outdoor games,
currently just in Prospect Park, Brooklyn. The goal is to create a stream of
diverse outdoor activities that people can join on a whim, and at the same time
to provide a platform for people to create and share events of their own.
Examples of such games could be pick-up soccer, capture the flag, frisbee, etc.
</p>

<p> We live in a world that is more isolated and virtual than ever before.
Let's get people together, in person, having fun, and moving their bodies â€”
    playing games <i>in real space!</i>

<p> Games in real space is invite-only. If you would like to join and do not
have an invitation, you can send an email to <a
href="mailto:webmaster@inreal.space">webmaster@inreal.space</a>. </p>
